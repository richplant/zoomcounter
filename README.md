# zoomcounter

Flask app that uses Oauth 2.0 flow to get access token for Zoom API, list live meetings and get a count of participants.

**Probably won't work for you** 

Zoom has a poorly documented (as far as I could see) limitation on the endpoints you're allowed to use, unless you're at a certain tier of paid user. 
Didn't work for me, but I didn't want to waste what I've done, so I'm putting it up for archival purposes.
